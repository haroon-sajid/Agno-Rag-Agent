# Cursor Rules for RAG Chatbot Project
- Focus on simple, maintainable code that actually runs
- Prefer Agno built-ins over custom implementations when possible
- Write tests for all new functionality using pytest
- Use modern Python typing (list[str], str | None)
- Keep async code non-blocking and properly handled
- Validate all file uploads and error conditions
- Document why custom abstractions are needed over library features
- Ensure streaming works end-to-end before adding features
- Use Pydantic models for all structured data
- Maintain clear separation between FastAPI backend and NiceGUI UI
